      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hello. My name is David, a software developer with {`${getExp(firstProExp)}`} of professional{" "}
        <Link href="/experience">experience</Link>. I specialize in building softwares using Flutter, React, and
        Typescript.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always had curiosity toward all things computer related. I used to tinker with my PC; breaking them apart
        and putting them back together, messing around with Windows installations, and even used Linux at some point
        before I knew anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hands-on curiosity made me decide to try to have a career in programming by getting into{" "}

          Hacktiv8&apos;s
        </Link>{" "}
        full stack Javascript bootcamp. I chose this particular platform since they have an income share agreement
        program, allowing me to pay for myself after my study is complete.
      </p>

      <h2>Career Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My professional experience started at{" "}
        <Link href="https://qios-id.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Qios
        </Link>
        , a company focused in providing self-service systems to FnB, transportation, and service industries. I became
        one of the first two programmers here, which was quite the challenge, but I believe it gave me the opportunity
        to develop unique set of skills and taking full ownership of several impactful projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my proudest achievements was developing a self-service bus ticketing platform that processes tens of
        thousands of transactions per month. This was my first professional project and also the first one using
        Flutter; a tool I had to learn during my first month here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some exciting features I worked on during this project were QRIS and EDC payment integration, communicating with
        the device&apos;s printing hardware using Java and AIDL, seat booking feature, and creating a simple error
        tracking/debugging tool using Firestore and Crashlytics.

        I enjoy programming for <Link href="/projects">fun</Link>, playing Dota 2, and reading sci-fi books (my favorite
